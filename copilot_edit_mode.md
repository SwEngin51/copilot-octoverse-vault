## ‚úÖ General Availability (GA) Features
- UniÔ¨Åed Chat view For the past several months, we've had a "Chat" view for asking questions to the language model, and a "Copilot Edits" view for an AI-powered code editing session.
- ‚óè Edit: In Edit mode, the model can make directed edits to multiple Ô¨Åles.
- ‚óè Edit mode: optimized for making edits across multiple Ô¨Åles in your codebase.
- Once agent mode is enabled for you, you will see a mode dropdown in the Copilot Edits view ‚Äî simply select Agent.
- Learn more about Copilot Edits agent mode or read the agent mode announcement blog post.
- ReÔ¨Åned editor integration We have polished the integration of Copilot Edits with code and notebook editors: ‚óè No more scrolling while changes are being applied.
- Changes for Copilot Edits are live, they are applied and saved as they are made and users keep or undo them.
- Refreshed UI In preparation for unifying Copilot Edits with Copilot Chat, we've given Copilot Edits a facelift.
- Removed Copilot Edits limits Previously, you were limited to attach 10 Ô¨Åles to your prompt in Copilot Edits.
- Change completions model You could already change the language model for Copilot Chat and Copilot Edits, and now you can also change the model for inline suggestions.
- Today, we're now announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits!
- Copilot Edits is optimized for code editing and enables you to make code changes across multiple Ô¨Åles in your workspace, directly from chat.
- ‚óè When the changes are computed and applied, the same Ô¨Çow and UI as for Copilot Edits are used.
- We are experimenting and measuring its effectiveness but it can also be enabled manually, github.copilot.chat.editor.temporalContext.enabled for Inline Chat and github.copilot.chat.edits.temporalContext.enabled for Copilot Edits.
- You can try out Copilot Edits by opening the Copilot menu in the Command Center, and then selecting Open Copilot Edits, or by triggering unassigned.
- Progress and editor controls Copilot Edits can make multiple changes across different Ô¨Åles.
- Move chat session to Copilot Edits You might use the Chat view to explore some ideas for making changes to your code.
- Instead of applying individual code blocks, you can now move the chat session to Copilot Edits to apply all code suggestions from the session.
- Working set suggested Ô¨Åles In Copilot Edits, the working set determines the Ô¨Åles that Copilot Edits can suggest changes for.
- To help you add relevant Ô¨Åles to the working set, for a Git repo, Copilot Edits can now suggest additional Ô¨Åles based on the Ô¨Åles you've already added.
- For example, Copilot Edits will suggest Ô¨Åles that are often changed together with the Ô¨Åles you've already added.
- Add to working set from Explorer, Search, and editor You can add Ô¨Åles to your Copilot Edits working set with the new Add File to Copilot Edits context menu action for search results in the Search view and for Ô¨Åles in the Explorer view.
- Additionally, you can also attach a text selection to Copilot Edits from the editor context menu.
- Add Context We‚Äôve added new ways to include symbols and folders as context in Copilot Chat and Copilot Edits, making it easier to reference relevant information during your workÔ¨Çow.
- Symbols Symbols can now easily be added to Copilot Chat and Copilot Edits by dragging and dropping them from the Outline View or Breadcrumbs into the Chat view.
- When a folder is dragged into Copilot Edits, all Ô¨Åles within the folder are included in the working set.
- Based on your prompts, Copilot Edits proposes code changes across multiple Ô¨Åles in your workspace.
- Copilot Edits is great for iterating on large changes across multiple Ô¨Åles.
- Get started with Copilot Edits in just three steps:  Start an edit session by selecting Open Copilot Edits from the Chat menu, or press unassigned.

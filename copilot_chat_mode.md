- To use a tool set in a chat query, reference it by #-mentioning its name, like #gh-news.
- You can also choose it from the tool picker in the chat input box.
- Prompts are accessible as slash / commands in chat, in the format /mcp.servername.promptname.
- It is available in several places:  Resources returned from MCP tool calls are available to the model and can be saved in chat, either via a Save button or by dragging the resource onto the Explorer view.
- button in chat, then selecting MCP Resources....
- Finally, attachments from the chat input box are now more navigable.
- Implicit context We've streamlined and simpliﬁed the way that adding your current ﬁle as context works in chat.
- Learn more about adding context in chat in our documentation.
- Each chat mode comes with a set of base instructions that describe how the LLM should handle a request, as well as the list of tools that can be used for that.
- You can now deﬁne your own custom chat modes, which can be used in the Chat view.
- Custom chat modes allow you to tailor the behavior of chat and specify which tools are available in that mode.
- For example, you can create a custom chat mode for planning new features, which only has read-only access to your codebase.
- To deﬁne and use a custom chat mode, follow these steps:  Deﬁne a custom mode by using the Chat: Conﬁgure Chat Modes command from the Command Palette.
- Provide the instructions and available tools for your custom chat mode in the *.chatprompt.md ﬁle that is created.
- In the Chat view, select the chat mode from the chat mode dropdown list.
- Submit your chat prompt and Unset  The following example shows a custom "Planning" chat mode: --- description: Generate an implementation plan for new features or refactoring existing code.

- Find Marketplace extensions with the extensions tool Use the extensions tool (#extensions) in chat to ﬁnd extensions from the Marketplace.
- Chat input improvements We have made several improvements to the chat input box: ● Attachments: when you reference context in the prompt text with #, they now also appear as an attachment pill.
- Chat mode keyboard shortcuts The keyboard shortcut ⌃⌘I still just opens the Chat view, but the ⇧⌘I shortcut now opens the Chat view and switches to agent mode.
- If you'd like to set up keyboard shortcuts for other chat modes, there is a command for each mode: ● workbench.action.chat.openAgent ● workbench.action.chat.openEdit ● workbench.action.chat.openAsk Autoﬁx diagnostics from agent mode edits Setting: github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix If a ﬁle edit in agent mode introduces new errors, agent mode can now detect them, and automatically propose a follow-up edit.
- Check out the agent mode documentation or select agent mode from the chat mode picker in the Chat view.
- You can see the list of MCP servers and their current status using the MCP: List Servers command, and pick the tools available for use in chat by using the Select Tools button in agent mode.
- Use @ to invoke built-in chat participants or from installed extensions.
- Check our release notes to learn more about how you can attach and use images in chat.
- Instead of having to move between separate views and lose the context of a conversation, you can now easily switch between the different chat modes.
- Chat prerelease channel mismatch If you have the prerelease version of the Copilot Chat extension installed in VS Code Stable, a new welcome screen will inform you that this conﬁguration is not supported.
- We've also made various improvements to the prompt and behavior of agent mode: ● The undo and redo actions in chat now undo or redo the last ﬁle edit made in a chat response.
- Note: This feature is currently only available in VS Code Insiders with the pre-release version of GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Refreshed UI In preparation for unifying Copilot Edits with Copilot Chat, we've given Copilot Edits a facelift.
- Only ﬁles that have been modiﬁed with AI are added to the changed ﬁles list, which is located above the chat input part.
- Smoother authentication ﬂows in chat If you host your source code in a GitHub repository, you're able to leverage several features, including advanced code searching, the @github chat participant, and more!
- To make this experience smoother, we've introduced this conﬁrmation in chat:  Not only is it not as jarring as a modal dialog, but it also has new functionality:  Grant: you're taken through the regular authentication ﬂow like before (via the modal).
- More advanced codebase search in Copilot Chat Setting: github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled When you add #codebase to your Copilot Chat query, Copilot helps you ﬁnd relevant code in your workspace for your chat prompt.

- With the introduction of the new Chat menu next to the Command Center, bringing up the Secondary Side Bar with chat is just a click away: The chat menu gives you access to the most common tasks for Copilot Chat.
- To make it easier to use chat participants with natural language, Copilot Chat will automatically route your question to a suitable participant or chat command, when possible.
- If you choose Send, the request is sent directly to Copilot Chat and it won't be automatically dispatched to a chat participant.
- Control current editor context Copilot Chat has always automatically included your current selection or the currently visible code as context with your chat request.
- We now show a special attachment control in the chat input that gives a hint about the editor context and which enables you to toggle whether or not to include the editor context.
- Interactive workspace symbol links A common use case of Copilot Chat is asking questions about the code in your workspace, such as using /tests to generate new unit tests for the selected code or asking @workspace to ﬁnd some speciﬁc class or function in your project.
- This milestone, we added enhanced links for any workspace symbols that Copilot mentions in chat responses.
- Switch language models in chat Previously, we announced that you can sign up for early access to OpenAI o1 models.
- Once you have access, you will have a Copilot Chat model picker control in Copilot Chat in VS Code to choose which model version to use for your chat conversations.
- Once you have access, you will have a Copilot Chat model picker control in Copilot Chat in VS Code to choose which model version to use for your chat conversations.

- When you use @vscode in Copilot Chat, /startDebugging is now available by default.
- Thumbs down feedback details Did you get a response from Copilot Chat that wasn't what you expected?
- To make it easier to use chat participants with natural language, in the coming weeks, we're experimenting with enabling Copilot Chat to automatically route your question to a suitable participant or chat command.
- GPT-4o Upgrade for Copilot Chat We've upgraded the Copilot Chat view from GPT-4-Turbo to GPT-4o, OpenAI's most powerful model to date.
- This was evident during the rollout, as developers increasingly used the Copilot Chat view and incorporated more of its code suggestions.
- Public code matching in chat You can allow GitHub Copilot to return code that could match publicly available code on GitHub.com.
- We are working on enabling showing you these matches for public code in Copilot Chat as well.

- #ﬁle context variable There are a few context variables that you can already use by typing # in the chat input, and we've added #file to let you include a speciﬁed ﬁle in your workspace as context with your chat prompt.
- Default context in chat Previously, we would include two types of context from the active code editor with your chat requests by default:  If there was a text selection, then the selection would be included  And if there was no selection, then the range of code in the visible viewport of the active editor would be included We've found that the second type can lead to confusion when you want to ask a generic question, but the LLM interprets it as a question about the code in your editor that was included as context.
- Notice in this example how the @terminal agent knows how ﬁle paths are formed when used in the microsoft/vscode repository:  There are also convenient follow-ups to explain suggested commands, which are presented as blue sparkle links just above the chat input box:  Activating the Explain follow-up gives a detailed explanation of the suggested command:  Authentication upgrade dialog when using GitHub remote search capabilities on private repos If enabled for your user account, when you use the @workspace agent, Copilot Chat searches your workspace using remote search capabilities.
